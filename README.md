* Honda Civic (2018)
* Ford F-150 (2020)
* Toyota Camry (2012)

Remove Vehicle:
Make: Honda
Model: Civic
Year: 2018

Current Fleet:

* Toyota Corolla (2015)
* Ford F-150 (2020)
* Toyota Camry (2012)




Hint: 

To create a list refer to our last example where we have list of items ikem saw in the market n was pricing like below

List<String> goods= [“apple”, “banana”];

You can also create an empty list of item and add items to it like below 



List<int> scores = []; // empty list

// adding item into the list
scores.add(70);

To be submitted tomorrow 
scores.add(40);
