# Ekukecare
Objective: Create a Dart program that simulates caring for a pet(Ekuke). You'll use variables, if statements, and while loops to keep your pet happy and healthy!

Story:

You've adopted a cute little dog named Ekuke . Ekuke needs regular care to stay happy and healthy. Your goal is to keep Ekuke’s hunger, happiness, and energy levels in check.

Instructions:

1. Declare variables for: <br>
    - Hunger (initially 10)
    - Happiness (initially 5)
    - Energy (initially 8)
2. Use a while loop to simulate days (up to 10 days). <br>
3. Within the loop:
    - Use if statements to:
        - Feed Ekuke(decrease hunger by 3) if hunger > 5
        - Play with Ekuke(increase happiness by 2) if happiness < 8
        - Give Ekuke a nap (increase energy by 2) if energy < 6
    - Display Ekuke’scurrent status (hunger, happiness, energy) each day
4. After the loop, display a final message based on Ekuke’s overall well-being: */
